# Alfredo - Hackathon Build (Archived)
The original prototype for a WhatsApp assistant we made in 3 hours during a half-day event. 
Archiving the code here because I plan on working on it from scratch, with my own MCP server.

# Overview
We built this in a very short time duration to present what an agentic WhatsApp companion was supposed to look like, if it had (most of) the capabilities of what a friend or an assistant has to help you manage your life better.
This version, while functional, is an extremely simplified version of what Alfredo was planned to be.
Current implementation uses the [Google Calendar MCP](https://github.com/nspady/google-calendar-mcp) and a scheduler to remind you of your events via WhatsApp text (using unofficial API, be careful if you try to run it).

# Why Keep This Version?
Majorly to respect the contribution of my teammates during those 3 hours, and to preserve the original iteration (and because it [came in the newspaper](https://www-mathrubhumi-com.translate.goog/technology/news/ai-app-alfredo-task-reminder-amrita-students-suy2jy82?_x_tr_sl=ml&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp&_x_tr_hist=true) somehow?)

# The New Alfredo
The new repository for Alfredo can be found [here](https://github.com/mitran06/alfredo). If the link does not work, I am yet to make the repository public.
